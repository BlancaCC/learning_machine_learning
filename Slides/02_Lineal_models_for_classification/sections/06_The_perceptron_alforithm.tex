    Is another importan example of a linear discriminant model. 
    Was introduced by Rosenblatt in 1962. 
    Two class model 
    \begin{equation}
        y(x)
        = 
        f(w^T \phi(x))
    \end{equation}
    where the nonlinear activation function $f$ is given by a 
    step function of the form 

    \begin{equation}
        f(x)= \left\{ \begin{array}{lcc}
            +1,  & a \geq 0 \\
            \\ -1, & a < 0  \\
            \end{array}
  \right.
    \end{equation}

    The vector $\phi(x)$ will typically include a bias component
    $\phi_0(x) = 1$.
